# Nutribros
"Nutribros" is aimed at individuals who want to control their nutritional status or achieve specific goals such as weight, loss maintain or gain. We have developed this application to cater to those needs. As soon as the user logs in, we will ask them about their goal and gather all the necessary data to calculate their Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). This information will help us determine the number of calories they need to consume daily in order to achieve their goal. Based on this, we will provide them with a personalized diet plan that will serve as a guide.

## Documentation
All the necessary documentation is included in the "documentation" package. You will also find user and administrator manuals there, providing detailed instructions on how to use the application from both user and administrator perspectives.

## Future updates
- The premium user can modify their diet.
- The premium user can exclude meals that contain a specific ingredient will be added.
- All users will have the ability to create combined type diets, such as celiac-vegan or celiac-vegetarian.
